# -Churn-Prediction
The project was engineered for Streamworks Media, a fast growing UK-based video streaming company competing with global players like Netflix and Amazon prime.The primary objective of this analysis was to identify the drivers of user churn and evaluate the impact of various behavioral and demographic factors on customer retention for Streamworks. Understand churn patterns: Who is churning and why?, Predict churn probability to enable early intervention and Explore revenue-impacting behaviours, such as usage and tenure. Despite testing several hypotheses, the findings indicate that common indicators (such as promotions and watch time) do not significantly influence churn in this dataset. Instead, user complaints and missing data profiles are the most significant indicators of potential churn.
